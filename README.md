# sassy-planets
This is a SCSS project for the Reykjavik school of web development


This is the SASSY COSMOS!

its a crash course in what I think is useful tooling in Sassy CSS.

I made planets and made them float so it would feel like in space while learning Sassy CSS.

I used Sassy CSS and compiled it into the CSS file you see in this Glitch file.
