                <p>The ampersand (&) is a wonderful little character. It’s an ancient symbol, a ligature of the Latin “Et,” that connects words, phrases, and thoughts. Today, the use of & has become more varied, but & still maintains its original meaning of and, as well as, or this too. In Sass, & references the parent selector of a declaration block, allowing the selector to be referenced from within itself. This means things like pseudo selectors, sibling selectors, and so on can be referenced and grouped with that selector’s other declarations. & is a powerful tool to organize and extend your Sass.</p>

                <p>One of the most common uses for & in my Sass is pseudo class selectors. This include the :hover</p>

                <p>When utilizing & in Sass, a single declaration block can be written for a. Then from within the block, a can be referenced with &:hover.</p>
